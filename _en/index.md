As research becomes more computing intensive,
researchers need more computing skills.
Being able to write code and use version control is a start;
the goal of this training is to help you take your next steps
so that:

-   other people (including your future self) can re-do your analyses,
-   you and the people using your results can be confident that they're correct,
-   and re-using your software is easier than rewriting it.

These lessons are the second of three parts of [Merely Useful][config-organization].
Each part is designed as a one-semester course:

1.  [One Extra Fact][one-extra-fact]
    is the fundamentals that every researcher ought to know
    (basically, what [the Carpentries][carpentries] teach, but in more detail).
2.  This course,
    [Still Magic][config-website],
    is more advanced material for people whose primary role is building research software.
    The learner profiles below describe its intended audience in more detail.
3.  Finally,
    [Set On Fire][set-on-fire]
    is intended for those who find themselves running larger projects with external collaborators.

This material is based on:

-   "A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects" [Nobl2009](#BIB)
-   "Ten Simple Rules for Making Research Software More Robust" [Tasc2017](#BIB)
-   "Best Practices for Scientific Computing" [Wils2014](#BIB)
-   "Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing" [Wils2017](#BIB)
-   The [Software Carpentry][swc] and [Data Carpentry][dc] lessons

For notes on how these lessons were designed, please see [s:design](#APPENDIX)
and [Wils2018](#BIB).

## Who Are These Lessons For?

**Samira** completed a Master's in epidemiology five years ago, and
has worked since then for a small NGO.  She did a biostatistics course
during her degree, and has learned some more about R and Python by
doing a couple of online data science courses on her own, but has no
formal training in programming.

Samira would like to tidy up the scripts, data sets, and reports she
has created over the past few years in order to share them with two
junior staff the NGO has just hired.  These lessons will show her what
her first steps should be and what "done" looks like.

**Jun** completed an Insight Data Science fellowship last year, and
now works for a company that does forensic audits.  He has used a wide
variety of machine learning and visualization software, and has
collaborated on a couple of open source R packages.

Jun is supposed to spend 10% of his time on community projects, and
has decided to help review research papers for a forensic accounting
journal.  This course will show him what a mature data science project
should look like so that he can evaluate the papers he is sent.  It
will also show him what improvements his firm's clients should make to
their internal analysis pipelines.

## Summary

For researchers and data scientists who have a basic understanding of the Unix shell, Python, and Git,
and who want to be more productive and have more confidence in their results,
this training course
provides a pragmatic, tools-based introduction to program design and maintenance.
Unlike academic software engineering courses and most books aimed at professional software developers,
this course uses data analysis as a motivating example
and assumes that the learner's ultimate goal is to answer a question rather than ship an application.

Learners must be comfortable with the basics of the Unix shell, Python, and Git
at the level covered by the core [Software Carpentry][swc] lessons.
They will need a personal computer with Internet access,
the Bash shell,
Python 3,
and a GitHub account.
